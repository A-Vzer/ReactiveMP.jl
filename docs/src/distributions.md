# Distributions

`ReactiveMP.jl` library uses probability distributions types from [`Distributions.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) package. It also provides a wider range of possible parametrisations for some probability distributions, e.g `NormalMeanPrecision` or `MvNormalMeanPrecision` which might be more efficient in some situations.
